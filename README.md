# Simple application that applies Butterworth, Gaussian & Ideal kernels on HPF and LPFs -aka Frequency Domain Filtering- 
Upload image from sidebar, set the parameters and it will return the image, kernel and the graph of distance (D(u,v)) against the filter function (H(u,v)).

# To run the project: 
- Open a Python environment (preferably 3.7 or 3.8)
- run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- Lastly, run "streamlit run app.py", this will serve the application at http://localhost:8501/.
